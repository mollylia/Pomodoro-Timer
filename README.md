# My Personal Project

## Pomodoro Timer

The application will allow users to **schedule focused work sessions with short breaks** to help with concentration and
productivity. Users set time intervals, and a timer displays the current interval on the screen with an option to
automatically start the next one once the current one has ended or be notified once each interval ends. This application
is intended for students who have trouble staying focused or for those who need reminders to take breaks.

This project interests me because I am searching for an application that meets my needs. That is, an application that
allows me to schedule different time intervals and have them start automatically once the preceding one has ended and
notifies me once an interval has ended. The Pomodoro timers I tried do not have these features, so I miss scheduled
breaks, and manually changing or starting the timer becomes annoying.


### User stories for the Pomodoro timer:

- As a user, I want to be able to set times of different time intervals for studying and breaks, and have them
automatically start once the preceding one has ended.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a study session onto a list of other sessions so I get many sessions that can vary
in their duration.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the remaining time on the current time interval.
- As a user, I want to be notified when an interval has ended.
