# My Personal Project

## Pomodoro Timer

The application will allow users to **schedule focused work sessions with short breaks** to help with concentration and
productivity. Users set time intervals, and a timer displays the current interval on the screen with an option to
automatically start the next one once the current one has ended or to be notified at the end of each interval. There is
also a to-do list feature to help them **prioritize their tasks** and track what they still need to complete. This
application is intended for students who have trouble staying focused or for those who need reminders to take breaks.

This project interests me because I am searching for an application that meets my needs. That is, an application that
(1) allows me to schedule different time intervals and have them start automatically once the preceding one has ended,
(2) notifies me once an interval has ended, (3) has the timer running even when other applications are open, and (4) has
a to-do list feature to it. The pomodoro timers I tried do not have all these aspects, so it becomes annoying when I
need to manually change or start the timer or constantly miss my breaks and end up loosing productivity.
